# Hello Cyrus!

Let's start with the first program:

```cyrus 
import std::io;

fn main() {
    io::printfn("Hello, Cyrus\n");
}
```

<br />

## Compiling the program

Let's take the above program and put it in a file called **hello_world.cyrus**.

We can then run it with:

```bash
cyrus run hello_world.cyrus
```

It should print Hello, World! and return back to the command line prompt.
