# Hello Cyrus!

Let's start with the first program:

```cyrus 
import std::libc;

pub fn main() {
    libc::printf("Hello, Cyrus\n");
}
```

<br />

## Compiling the program

Let's take the above program and put it in a file called **hello_world.cyrus**.

We can then run it with:

```bash
cyrus run hello_world.cyrus
```

It should print `Hello, Cyrus!` and return back to the command line prompt.
