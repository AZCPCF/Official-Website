# Basic Syntax

This article is an introduction to the Cyrus Programming Language. It assumes you already have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, statements, and types. Here, you’ll see how familiar ideas are expressed in Cyrus, while also being introduced to new concepts that make the language unique.

If you haven't installed Cyrus yet, start with the [Getting Started](/en/docs/getting-started/install-compiler-binary) guide before continuing.

## Comments

Comments are pieces of text ignored by the compiler.
They're useful for explaining code, leaving notes, or temporarily disabling parts of a program. Cyrus supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

- Single-line Comments

```cyrus
// This is a single-line comment
#msg: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!"; // You can also place it after code
```

- Multi-line Comments

```cyrus
/*
  Outer comment start
  /* Nested comment inside */
  Outer comment end

  NOTE: Multi-line comments can also be nested!
*/
```

## Const string and Character Literals

String literals in Cyrus are enclosed in double quotes **"xxx"**, while character literals are enclosed in single quotes **'x'**.
Both forms represent sequences of Unicode characters, but they differ in intent and usage:

- String literals produce values of type **char\***, which can hold arbitrarily many characters.
- Character literals produce values of type **char**, which always represent exactly one Unicode scalar value.

```cyrus
#greeting: char* = "Hello, Cyrus!";
#letter: char = 'A';
```

### Escapes

Special characters that are difficult to type directly or would otherwise break the syntax can be written using escape sequences. All escape sequences begin with a backslash (\).

Common escapes include:

- **\n** - newline (line feed, U+000A)
- **\t** - horizontal tab (U+0009)
- **\r** - carriage return (U+000D)
- **\b** - backspace (U+0008)
- **\a** - bell/alert (U+0007)
- **\v** - vertical tab (U+000B)
- **\f** - form feed (U+000C)
- **\\** - literal backslash
- **\"** - double quote (inside strings)
- **\'** - single quote (inside chars or strings)

Example:

```cyrus
#poem: char* = "Line one\nLine two\nLine three";
#quote: char* = "She said: \"Cyrus is great!\"";
#backslash: char = '\\';
```

<br />

### Unicode and Emojis

Cyrus supports Unicode characters directly in string and character literals. You can type emojis, accented letters, or any other Unicode characters inside quotes:

```cyrus
#letter: char = 'A';                     // ✅ Works
#smile: char* = "😇";                    // ✅ Works in a string
#rocket: string = "Let's go! \u{1F680}"; // ✅ Works, 🚀
#greek_alpha: char* = "\u03B1";          // ✅ Works, α
#emoji_char: char = '😇';                // ❌ Does NOT work
#multibyte_char: char = '\u263A';        // ❌ Does NOT work 
```
