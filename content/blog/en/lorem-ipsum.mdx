# The Art of Maintainability

Writing code is easy; writing code that your future self won't hate is the real challenge. As we move deeper into 2026, the focus has shifted from "clever" code to **clear** code.

### Why Simple is Better
In the Cyrus ecosystem, we prioritize simplicity over complex abstractions. Here is why:
1. **Lower Cognitive Load**: Easier to read means faster debugging.
2. **Easy Onboarding**: New team members can contribute within hours.
3. **Performance**: Simple code often allows the compiler to optimize more effectively.

### Code Example
Even in MDX, we can showcase how elegant a simple function looks:

```javascript
function greet(user) {
  return `Welcome to the future of development, ${user}!`;
}
